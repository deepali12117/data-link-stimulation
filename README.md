# data-link-stimulation

A web-based **Data Link Layer Simulation** project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This simulation visually represents how data is transmitted between two nodes over a communication channel, mimicking core principles of the **Data Link Layer** in the OSI model.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to **simulate data transmission** at the **Data Link Layer**, helping learners and enthusiasts understand how bits/frames are sent, acknowledged, or dropped due to simulated transmission errors.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For the basic structure
- **CSS3** – For layout and design
- **JavaScript** – For core simulation logic and interactivity

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧱 Simulation of data frames transmission
- ⚡ Visual transmission between sender and receiver
- 🔁 Acknowledgment mechanism (ACK/NAK)
- ❌ Frame loss or error simulation (optional)
- 🎛️ Control buttons: Start, Reset, Pause
- 📊 Status indicators for frame success or failure

---

## 🖼️ Sections Overview

- **Sender Node** – Where data originates
- **Receiver Node** – Where data is delivered
- **Transmission Path** – Visual flow of frames
- **Logs/Status Panel** – Real-time transmission info

Let me know if you want to:
- Add animations like sliding frames?
- Extend it to simulate **Stop-and-Wait**, **Go-Back-N**, or **Sliding Window Protocols**?
- Include your actual GitHub and email links?

I'd be happy to help with any of those!
